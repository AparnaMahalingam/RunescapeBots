def detect_runescape_windows():

def move_and_resize_runescape_windows():
	pass # this will move and resize the detected windows.
	# Initially this will just pass since we don't know how to do this, but further down the road we can add to this and implement it

def detect_ge_slots_and_member_status():
	pass # this will take in the location of the windows and scan each one to see whether or not it is a members account
	# which can be done by checking if there are slots that are unavailable to be used (for example have no buy bag in them)
	# then for each screen we want to detect how many available slots we have and the location of each
